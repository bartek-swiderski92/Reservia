Second Project in web developer path
<br>
<br>
Practical projects demonstrating basic HTML and CSS skills. No JS or frameworks included.

The project is based on following guidelines:
<br>
Hello!

I'm sending you the new desktop and mobile mock-ups of the Reservia website. The folder also includes the images. Here
are some details that will be useful for integration.

Features


Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input
field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
Each accommodation or activity card will have to be clickable in its entirety. For the moment, the links will be empty.
The filters will not be functional for this version; however, they must change their appearance when hovered over. I
leave it up to you to decide the most appropriate effect.
In the menu, the Accommodations and Activities links are anchors that should lead to sections of the page.

</ul>

Technical constraints

I’m providing you with two mock-ups: one desktop and one mobile. The site will also have to be adapted for tablets. You
are free to make the necessary adaptations with the layout, as long as no elements are cut, and the text is a sufficient
size. I’ll let you choose the appropriate breakpoints.
As I didn't know which image sizes and formats you need, I exported a variety. I’ll let you choose the most suitable
format concerning resolution and loading time.
The icons come from the Font Awesome library. The colors of the chart are blue #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF,
as well as grey for the background #F2F2.
The site font is Raleway.



If you have any questions, do not hesitate to write to me.

Have a nice day!
