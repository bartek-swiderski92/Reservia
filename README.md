### The project is based on below scenario:

> _From:  Loïc_  
>_To: Me_     
>_CC: Sarah (CTO)_  
>_Subject : Reservia mock-up integration_  
> ___
> _Hello!_  
 _I'm sending you the [new desktop and mobile mock-ups of the Reservia website](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P2+HTML+%26+CSS/Reservia+ressources+EN.zip). The folder also includes the images. Here are some details that will be useful for integration._  
 **_Features_**
 >* _Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional._
 >* _Each accommodation or activity card will have to be clickable in its entirety. For the moment, the links will be empty._
 >* _The filters will not be functional for this version; however, they must change their appearance when hovered over. I leave it up to you to decide the most appropriate effect._
 >* _In the menu, the Accommodations and Activities links are anchors that should lead to sections of the page._  
 > 
> **_Technical constraints_**
 >
 >* _I’m providing you with two mock-ups: one desktop and one mobile. The site will  also have to be adapted for tablets. You are free to make the necessary  adaptations with the layout, as long as no elements are cut, and the text is a   sufficient size. I’ll let you choose the appropriate breakpoints._
 >* _As I didn't know which image sizes and formats you need, I exported avariety.  I’ll let you choose the most suitable format concerning resolution and loading   time._
 >* _The icons come from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/). The colors of the chart are blue  #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background  #F2F2F2._
>* _The site font is [Raleway.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)_
>
>_If you have any questions, do not hesitate to write to me._
>
>_Have a nice day!_

_Subject : RE - Reservia mock-up integration_

>_Hello,_  
>
>_I hope that the first elements shared by Loïc are clear to you! As this is your first project with us and you're interning, I wanted to give you a little more guidance:_  
>* _Don't use a framework or a pre-compiler for this project (like SASS for instance): since you are just starting out, I prefer that  you sharpen your skills using HTML and CSS and learn to code from scratch. We want to test your skills on that!_  
>* _I recommend using Visual Studio Code. The plugins can make your life easier (for example, Live Server or Prettier)._  
>* _You can integrate Font Awesome icons in HTML or CSS. I strongly advise you to use Flexbox, but you can also use CSS Grid if you want._  
>* _Your code will have to use semantic tags and not contain any errors or warnings when running it through the W3C HTML and CSS validator._  
>* _The site should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox._  
>* _Remember to separate HTML and CSS and to organize your folders accordingly._  
>* _Don't forget to version your code with Git from the beginning! It will help your team track your work. We use GitKraken as a Git client, it's nicer than the command line, but you can you use whatever you want. And then you need to deploy the page on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages (your choice which one)._
