<br>
<br>
Practical projects demonstrating basic HTML and CSS skills. No JS or frameworks included.

The project is based on following guidelines:
<br>
<br>

 _Hello!_  
 _I'm sending you the new desktop and mobile mock-ups of the Reservia website. The folder also includes the images. Here are some details that will be useful for integration._  
 **_Features_**
 * _Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional._
 * _Each accommodation or activity card will have to be clickable in its entirety. For the moment, the links will be empty._
 * _The filters will not be functional for this version; however, they must change their appearance when hovered over. I leave it up to you to decide the most appropriate effect._
 * _In the menu, the Accommodations and Activities links are anchors that should lead to sections of the page._  
  
 **_Technical constraints_**
 
 * _I’m providing you with two mock-ups: one desktop and one mobile. The site will  also have to be adapted for tablets. You are free to make the necessary  adaptations with the layout, as long as no elements are cut, and the text is a   sufficient size. I’ll let you choose the appropriate breakpoints._
 * _As I didn't know which image sizes and formats you need, I exported avariety.  I’ll let you choose the most suitable format concerning resolution and loading   time._
 * _The icons come from the Font Awesome library. The colors of the chart are blue  #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background  #F2F2F2._
* _The site font is Raleway._

_If you have any questions, do not hesitate to write to me._

_Have a nice day!_
